# Provide things that utilize the `alloc` crate, namely `TinyVec`.
alloc = []

# (not part of Vec!) Extra methods to let you grab the slice of memory after the

# use const generics for arrays

# EXPERIMENTAL: Not part of SemVer. It adds `core::fmt::Write` to `ArrayVec`
# and `SliceVec`. It works on Stable Rust, but Vec normally supports the
# `std::io::Write` trait instead of `core::fmt::Write`, so we're keeping it as
# an experimental impl only for now.

# EXPERIMENTAL: Not part of SemVer. This adds an "ArraySet" type which is
# an array backed set type for situations where you need a set of a known
# small size without allocation.

# features that require rustc 1.40
